# Regular expressions

[lecture slides](./slides.md)

This week we're focusing in on one tool with significance across many platforms,
programming languages and application domains: the patterns for string searching
and manipulation known as 'regular expressions'. While intimidating at first
glance, once you learn to deconstruct them they can become a natural way of
thinking about (most) patterns in text. Two of the most powerful Unix tools,
`grep` and `sed`, are heavily used as a convenient way to apply regular
expressions to search and replacement tasks, respectively.

## Pre-reading

We're going to start pushing you to read the helpful `man` pages that exist for
most Unix tools. On your Debian VM, type `man grep`. This brings up the help
pages for `grep`, which you'll want to refer to in the labs. If you scroll down
past the options specific to the utility, however, you will see a section headed
'REGULAR EXPRESSIONS' which gives you an introduction to the syntax. Read this
before you try the exercises for this week.
